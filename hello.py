"""Notes about syntax:
		*	automatically includes a new line character '\n'
		*	parenthesis unecessary to use the print function
		*	libraries are already accessible to the compiler w/ out a specific 'include <...>'
		*	Return key 'Enter' signifies end of use of the function.
				- No need for end of line character ';'
				- How would I be able to span the contents of a funciton across multiple lines?

				You need to explicitly change the default newline character to a space or a tab.
